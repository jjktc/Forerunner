overflow question{
title:
Creating a multiplayer over-network game in Java
content:
I am working on a video game and wanted to add multiplayer. I wanted people to be able to play against others over the net.
Option 1:
Games are hosted by a web server somehow... and random players can join the game
Option 2:
Games are hosted by a certain person. Another person who doesn't have to know the ip of the other, can join the hosted game.
I would like to know how i could achieve these because I can't find anywhere that explains either. Maybe I am not searching hard enough.
If more information is required, just tell me and I can provide it.

atb can make guns by setting fire point, hand holds etc
define handhold and nozzle and animations/positions
button switches view to player fp
atb can make bi-image particles, mono-image particles, cubic particles

scale weapons to accurate size compared to 2 unit person

cloak energy drain (per second){
standing still: 5
crouching: 2
proning: 1
walking: 7
sprinting: 10
crouch walking: 7
prone crawling: 6
}
if you are shot, enemies can see you at 33% opacity
if you get hit by an emp, your cloak turns off
if you get hit by a pulse grenade, your energy drains to nothing

first 20 people get a code that unlocks the sniper rifle for multiplayer

It is raining and there is tall grass around.
