check if can use forerunner name

Hi, some friends and I started work on a video game and we wanted to call it "Forerunner"
Recently someone asked if it had to do with halo, and told me that i probably can't use
the name even if it has nothing to do with our game and that they would file a lawsuit
if we used it. I was not aware that we couldn't use the name. I have played halo 4, but
forgot that the name forerunner was mentioned at some point. I was wondering if we can't
use the name "Forerunner" as the title of our game. We intend to release it commercially.
I was wondering if this was the correct place to ask that question. If not could you tell
me where I should address this issue. If so, could you tell me if it is ok? If you need any
extra information we would be happy to provide it. Oh and halo was an awesome game. It should
have cost more.

create all required concept art

create all required 3d models

decide release date

create debut video

make as little like halo as possible. dont want people to go "hey, that looks like halo!"

check if game engines utilizing lwjgl can be sold commercially.

Hi, some friends and I started work on a video game and started working on a game engine. This game
engine provides the necessary components for 3d and 2d games along with physics. It also utilizes
lwjgl for rendering. We were wondering if you are allowed to sell game engines using lwjgl commercially.
Thanks.
